This is inspired by [__Twitter Fans__](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-fans/)however
Show Twitter Followers uses caching to keep the information of your present followers.
Twitter places a limit on the number of API requests you can make in an hour
so Show Twitter Followers keeps the data in the database which is updated hourly. The maximum number of followers that you can show is 30.
